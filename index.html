<h1>100 Days of Code</h1>
    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>10/31/2018</p>
    <p>Reviewed a bunch of FreeCodeCamp's Basic HTML/HTML5 and Basic CSS exercises. Tomorrow I plan on finishing Basic CSS and moving
    into the Applied Visual Design exercises.<p>
    
    <h2>Day 2</h2>
    <p>11/1/2018</p>
    <p>Finished up Basic CSS on FreeCodeCamp like I wanted to. Going to start into Applied Visual Design.</p>
    
    <h2>Day 3</h2>
    <p>11/2/2018</p>
    <p>Today I made it about half way through the Applied Visual Design challanges. Tomorrow I will try to finish it up and spend any 
    leftover time on applying the new skills and ideas to this page. If I don't get it done tomorrow I'll work on this page Sunday too and 
    pick up with FreeCodeCamp on Monday.</p>
