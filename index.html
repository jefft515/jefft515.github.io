        <div class="card-body">
            <p>Reviewed a bunch of FreeCodeCamp's Basic HTML/HTML5 and Basic CSS exercises. Tomorrow I plan on finishing Basic CSS and moving
            into the Applied Visual Design exercises.<p>

        <div class="card-body">
            <p>Today I made it about half way through the Applied Visual Design challanges. Tomorrow I will try to finish it up and spend any 
            leftover time on applying the new skills and ideas to this page. If I don't get it done tomorrow I'll work on this page Sunday too and 
            pick up with FreeCodeCamp on Monday.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
            <p>Well, I didn't get as far as I wanted to today in the Applied Visual Design challanges.  I kind of got caught up playing on 
            some of the challanges. I should have no problem finishing up tomorrow and working on styling this site.</p>

            <p>Trying to get a better understanding of git, github and github desktop.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
            <p>Didn't get much done today. Made a small fix on this page and worked a handfull of FreeCodeCamp exercises. Only did about a half a hour. Maybe I'll do
                more after work tonight but I doubt it.</p>
