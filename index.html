            <h1>Cheating at Boardgames</h1>
                <article>
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>I wrote this article because we all know that your worth as a person depends on winning.  If you lose a game you 
                    are clearly not intelligent.  This article is for all of us lesser people who need to boost self esteem because we can't win
                    on our own.</p>
                    
                    <h2>What is cheating</h2>
                    <p>Cheating is the best way to win.  It is the best way to insure that you win and prove that you are batter than 
                    everybody else.</p>
                    
                    <h2>When to cheat</h2>
                    <p>Whenever you can get away with it.</p>
                    
                    <h2>How to cheat</h2>
                    <p></p>
                    
                    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
                    <p>Hopefully, everyone reading this see this a joke. I'm learning web development and needed some filler to play
                    with.</p>
